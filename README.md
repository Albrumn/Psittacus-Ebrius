"Linguam Latinam mēcum discite!"

## Inspiration
After completing the short, fourteen-unit Duolingo Latin course, I had a discussion with its former Trailblazer about the prospect of the course being extended.  It wasn't promising.  But this sparked an idea:  why not develop my own online Latin course?

Others in the chat quickly began making suggestions.

Will this vision ever become a reality?  Only time will tell.
